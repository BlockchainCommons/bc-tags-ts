# Blockchain Commons CBOR Tags Registry

### _by Leonardo Custodio_

**`bc-tags-ts`** is the registry of CBOR tags used across Blockchain Commons specifications, with their names and assigned values.

## Installation Instructions

[@blockchaincommons/tags](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blockchaincommons/tags) is published to npm. Install it with your package manager of choice:

```sh
npm install @blockchaincommons/tags
# or
pnpm add @blockchaincommons/tags
# or
yarn add @blockchaincommons/tags
# or
bun add @blockchaincommons/tags
```

## Usage Instructions

```typescript
import { TAG_ENVELOPE, TAG_LEAF, LEGACY_TAGS, ALL_TAGS, registerTags } from "@blockchaincommons/tags";
import { Tag, TagsStore, getGlobalTagsStore, taggedValue } from "@blockchaincommons/dcbor";

// Name every Blockchain Commons tag in the global dcbor store (idempotent).
registerTags();
getGlobalTagsStore().nameForValue(TAG_ENVELOPE.value); // "envelope"

// Or into a store of your own. A value already registered under a
// different name throws dcbor's CborError (code Custom); the same name is a no-op.
const store = new TagsStore();
registerTags(store);

// A Tag carries the number and the name; use it wherever dcbor takes a tag.
taggedValue(TAG_ENVELOPE, taggedValue(TAG_LEAF, "Hello.")); // 200(201("Hello."))

// Tags compare by value, never by reference.
Tag.equals(TAG_ENVELOPE, Tag.from(200, "envelope")); // true
TAG_ENVELOPE === Tag.from(200, "envelope"); // false — two objects

// Every constant is frozen: a wire name cannot be rewritten by mistake.
Object.isFrozen(TAG_ENVELOPE); // true

// Legacy (decode-only) tags are grouped; everything is iterable via ALL_TAGS.
LEGACY_TAGS.SEED_V1.value; // 300
ALL_TAGS.length; // 75
```

Runnable examples live in the [`examples/`](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-tags-ts/tree/master/examples) directory.

## Status - Beta

`bc-tags-ts` is currently under active development and in beta testing. It should not be used for production tasks until it has had further testing and auditing. See [Blockchain Commons' Development Phases](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/blob/master/release-path.md).

### Version History

- **Unreleased** - Requires `@blockchaincommons/dcbor` ^1.0.0-beta.3, so tags 2 and 3 are unnamed as in the reference's default build; the Rust harness checks identifiers, registration order, summarizers, dcbor's names, conflicts and rendering in both dcbor builds; registration-contract tests; conflicts documented as dcbor's `CborError`.
- **1.0.0-beta.2 (September 12, 2026)** - Documents the bignum-registration difference from Rust builds without `num-bigint`.
- **1.0.0-beta.1 (September 9, 2026)** - Initial beta implementation.

### Roadmap

- Continued testing and auditing on the path from beta to a stable **1.0.0** release.
- Continued parity with the Rust reference implementation as it evolves (see [`RUST_DIVERGENCES.md`](./RUST_DIVERGENCES.md)).

### Dependencies

`@blockchaincommons/tags` depends on `@blockchaincommons/dcbor` at runtime.

To build and work on this library, you'll need the following tools:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 22.12 - JavaScript runtime.
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) - used to install dependencies and run scripts (any node package manager works).
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) >= 5.7 - language and type checker.

### Derived from ...

This `bc-tags-ts` project is either derived from or was inspired by:

- [paritytech/bcts](https://github.com/paritytech/bcts) - A TypeScript port of many Blockchain Commons' specs, by [Parity Technologies](https://github.com/paritytech).
